# Introduction to C++

_"C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or 'C with Classes'.
The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities 
for low-level memory manipulation."_ - Wikipedia

### Language purpose
_"C++ was designed with an orientation toward systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with **performance, 
efficiency, and flexibility** of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being **software 
infrastructure and resource-constrained applications**, including **desktop applications, video games, servers** (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), 
and **performance-critical applications** (e.g. telephone switches or space probes)."_ - Wikipedia

**Paradigms:** procedural, functional, object-oriented, generic, modular.

**First appeared:** 1985.

**Influenced by:** C, Mesa, ALGOL 68.

**Influenced:** C#, D, Java, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, Rust.
